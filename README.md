# Towards Real World Federated Learning
### Machine Learning and Deep Learning 2023
#### Politecnico di Torino
Code for the Federated Learning project. Checkpoints of the performed experiments can be found at this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZAe2BeIY9TzB0Y22fVszJbyksgl-RDLE?usp=sharing).

## Setup
#### Environment
You can use CoLab to run the code.

#### Datasets
The repository supports experiments on the following datasets:
1. Reduced **Federated IDDA** from FedDrive [1]
   - Task: semantic segmentation for autonomous driving
   - 24 users
2. Reduced **GTA 5** datasets [2]

## How to run
The ```main.py``` orchestrates training. All arguments need to be specified through the ```args``` parameter (options can be found in ```utils/args.py```).

CoLab notebook examples can be found in the homonymous folder.
